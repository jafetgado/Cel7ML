>> cel7_all.fasta
Structure-based alignment of all 1,748 sequences but only containing positions in the full-length TreCel7A.

>> cbh_all.fasta
Structure-based alignment of 1,306 CBH sequences (from cel7a_all.fasta) but only containing positions in the full-length TreCel7A.

>> egl_all.fasta
Structure-based alignment of 442 EG sequences (from cel7a_all.fasta) but only containing positions in the full-length TreCel7A.

>> cel7_cat.fasta
Structure-based alignment of all 1,748 sequences but only containing positions in TreCel7A CD. Positions flanking the CD have been removed (i.e. signal peptide, CBM-linker domain).

>> cbh_cat.fasta
Structure-based alignment of 1,306 CBH sequences (from cel7a_cat.fasta), but only containing positions in TreCel7A CD.

>> egl_cat.fasta
Structure-based alignment of 442 CBH sequences (from cel7a_cat.fasta), but only containing positions in TreCel7A CD.

>> consensus.fasta
Consensus GH7 CBH and EG sequences determined from the alignments, cbh_cat.fasta and egl_cat.fasta
