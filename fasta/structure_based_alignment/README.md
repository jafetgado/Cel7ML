#### `structure_based_alignment/`: Contains fasta files used in stucture-based MSA of 1,748 sequences

`structure20_promals3d.fasta`: Structural alignment of 20 GH7 structures with Promals3d web server.

`structaln_mafft.fasta`: MAFFT MSA of 1,748 sequences added to the structural alignment of 20 GH7 structures (structure20_promals3d.fasta). Hence, contains 1,768 sequences in total.

`structure20_mafft.fasta`: An alignment of the 20 GH7 used in the structure alignment, but derived from the MAFFT add-sequences alignment, and with excess gaps removed.

`structure6_mafft.fasta`: An alignment of 6 selected sequences from structure20_mafft.fasta, used in making Figure 3A in the main text.

`cel7_nr99_structaln.fasta`: Final structure-based alignment of 1,748 GH7 sequences (i.e. after 20 GH7 sequences used in structural alignment removed from structaln_mafft.fasta)
